## Overview

Buttons are a way to perform actions within a page. They help interact with its content via a single click. According to
their style, specific labels and icons, they help understand the most important actions to take.

## Usage

```js
import { Button } from '@holicay/design-system';
```

<Canvas  of={ButtonStories.Primary} layout="centered">

</Canvas>

## Props

<Controls />

## Variants

Below, you can see a grid of the possible combinations a button can have upon it, for example we have different style
variants that can denote status & intention i.e. the `danger` variant would indicate a destructive action.

There are also other props such as `disabled` and `loading` that change the button. Buttons come in three sizes, `sm`,
`md`, `lg`, `xl` and `2xl`, and finally they can have an icon on the left or right side of the label.
